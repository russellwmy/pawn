# **Pawn Framework**

**Pawn** is an experimental framework for building autonomous, task-driven agents (**Pawns**) that explore and interact with modular environments (**Squares**). This framework prioritizes adaptability, secure execution, and collaboration in decentralized systems.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> **Pawn** is highly experimental and unstable. Enter this playground at your own risk and with boundless curiosity! 😜

## **Core Concepts**

### **Pawn: The Explorer and Messenger**

A **Pawn** is an autonomous WebAssembly-based agent tasked with traversing Squares to deliver messages, gather data, and perform specific jobs.

#### **Roles**  

- **Messenger**: Delivers payloads such as commands, data, or resources.  
- **Scout**: Explores Squares to collect information about their capabilities or resources.  
- **Executor**: Completes tasks assigned by the origin or the visited Square.  

#### **Key Characteristics**  

- **Autonomous**: Operates independently once deployed.  
- **Adaptable**: Reacts dynamically to the environment or mission context.  
- **Secure**: Leverages WebAssembly’s sandboxing for safe execution.

### **Square: The Modular Task Space**

A **Square** represents a self-contained environment where Pawns interact to complete tasks or access resources.

#### **Capabilities**  

- **Resource Provider**: Hosts tools, data, and APIs essential for the Pawn’s tasks.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Engages visiting Pawns to delegate tasks or exchange data.  
- **Isolation**: Operates independently, ensuring stability and task focus.

### **Pawn Runtime: The Operational Engine**

The **Pawn Runtime** powers the framework, enabling seamless interactions between Pawns and Squares. Built on **Wasmtime**, it provides a secure and efficient platform for executing WebAssembly modules.

#### **Features**  

- **Task Management**: Initializes, monitors, and finalizes Pawn operations.  
- **Communication**: Facilitates safe and structured exchanges between Pawns and Squares.  
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Enforces strict isolation to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## **Workflow**

1. **Deployment**: A Pawn is assigned a task or payload and dispatched to a designated Square.  
2. **Exploration**: The Pawn explores connected Squares if the initial target cannot fulfill the task.  
3. **Interaction**: The Pawn communicates with a Square to deliver messages, access resources, or complete jobs.  
4. **Result Handling**: The Pawn returns outcomes to its origin or continues to its next mission.
